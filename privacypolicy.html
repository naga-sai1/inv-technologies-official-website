              <p class="text-justify">
                When you use our website or app, we collect and store your
                information which is provided by you from time to time. In
                general, you can browse the website or app without telling us
                who you are or revealing any personal information about
                yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are
                not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields
                are required and which fields are optional. You always have the
                option to not provide information by choosing not to use a
                particular service, product or feature on the website or app.<br /><br />
                We may track your buying behaviour, preferences, and other
                information that you choose to provide on our website or app. We
                use this information to do internal research on our users'
                demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand,
                protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and
                analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include
                the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our
                Platform or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is
                on our Platform or not), your computer browser information, and
                your IP address.<br /><br />
                We collect personal information (such as email address, delivery
                address, name, phone number, credit card/debit card and other
                payment instrument details) from you when you set up an account
                or transact with us. While you can browse some sections of our
                website or app without being a registered member, certain
                activities (such as placing an order or consuming our online
                content or services) do require registration. We do use your
                contact information to send you offers based on your previous
                orders and your interests.<br /><br />
                If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or
                letters, or if other users or third parties send us
                correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website,
                we may collect such information into a file specific to you.<br /><br />
                If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms
                or other message areas or leave feedback, we will collect that
                information you provide to us. We retain this information as
                necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and
                troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.<br /><br />
                Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar
                devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third
                parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third
                parties.<br /><br />
                If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information
                about your buying behaviour.<br /><br />
                If you transact with us, we collect some additional information,
                such as a billing address, a credit / debit card number and a
                credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment
                instrument details.

              <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. How do we collect the Information?</h4>
              <p class="text-justify">
                We will collect personally identifiable information about you
                only as part of a voluntary registration process, on-line survey

                fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services. We do
                not disclose your personal information to third parties for
                their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit
                consent.<br /><br />
                We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law
                or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
                necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
                process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement
                offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith
                belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce

                advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a
                third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety
                of our users or the general public.<br /><br />
                We and our affiliates will share / sell some or all of your
                personal information with another business entity should we (or

                entity, or re-organization, amalgamation, restructuring of
                business. Should such a transaction occur that other business
                entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow
                this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.
